#AirAPI
AirAPI is a Node wrapper for AirBnb *unofficial* API.
AirBnb does not provide a public API, so this might/might not violate their policies.

##Search listings
  Airbnb.search(options, successCallback, failureCallback)

##Get listing(s) info
  Airbnb.info([listings IDs], options).then()

##Get availabily for listing(s)
